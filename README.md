# StudentERP
StudentERP is a mini ERP system built with Django to manage student academic records. It has two logins:  Admin Login – allows administrators to add and manage student marks.  Student Login – lets students check their marks by roll number.  The project also includes a Leaderboard that displays the top 3 students based on total marks.
It uses Django (Python) for the backend, HTML & CSS for the frontend, and SQLite3 as the database. The project runs inside a virtual environment (venv)
